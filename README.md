Cluster Analysis of Customer Segmentation
Project Overview
This project demonstrates customer segmentation through cluster analysis, which is a key technique for market research and gaining insights into customer behaviors. The goal of the project is to categorize customers into different clusters based on demographic and behavioral attributes, enabling more targeted marketing and customer relationship management.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The project involves cleaning and organizing the customer dataset for effective analysis.
Clustering Technique: Clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, are used to group customers based on features such as age, income, and spending scores.
Visualization: Various plots are generated to visualize the customer clusters and to help understand the distinguishing characteristics of each group.
CSV Output: The final clustered customer data is exported as a CSV file, which can be further used in business applications.
Files in the Repository
Cluster_Analysis_2.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the code and all the steps involved in the analysis.
Clustered customers.csv: The output file that contains customer clusters.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for data analysis and clustering.
Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used to implement clustering algorithms.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization.
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to perform the cluster analysis.
The results can be viewed and exported as a CSV file.
Future Improvements
Testing and comparing different clustering algorithms (such as DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering).
Automating the customer segmentation process for real-time data analysis.
Integrating the clustering results with a customer management system for actionable insights.
